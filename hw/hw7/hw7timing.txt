1a. Results for InsertRandomSpeedTest for N = 1000000:

Couldn’t get my program to work, so I don’t know what the results should be. It throws me an error when I run java InsertRandomSpeedTest, and I haven’t been able to pinpoint the problem.

1b. Results for InsertRandomSpeedTest for N = 2000000:

Couldn’t get my program to work, so I don’t know what the results should be. It throws me an error when I run java InsertRandomSpeedTest, and I haven’t been able to pinpoint the problem.

1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic in its scaling behavior for random strings?

If the iterator is supposed to linear, I’m assuming that the ECHashStringSet should look roughly linear in its scaling behavior for random strings.


2a. Results for InsertInOrderSpeedTest for N = 10000:

Couldn’t get my program to work, so I don’t know what the results should be. It throws me an error when I run java InsertRandomSpeedTest, and I haven’t been able to pinpoint the problem.

2b. Results for InsertInOrderSpeedTest for N = 20000:

Couldn’t get my program to work, so I don’t know what the results should be. It throws me an error when I run java InsertRandomSpeedTest, and I haven’t been able to pinpoint the problem.

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?

If the iterator is supposed to linear, I’m assuming that the BSTStringSet should look roughly linear in its scaling behavior for random strings.


Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (less than a minute).
